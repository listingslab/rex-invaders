> Rexlabs Branded Space Invaders made with React and stuff

Forked from [grancalavera/react-spaceinvaders](https://github.com/grancalavera/react-spaceinvaders)

## grancalavera's notes

- expect library to make simple tests
- deep-freeze
- spread operator
- slice to generate new arrays with changes on specific indices
- Object.assign to update objects
- a reducer must return the current state for any unknown action
- in the example the store is passed to the component in the view :|
- move sets the hero to move, but does not render
- probably it would be much easier to put all the sprites in a single array
- and then just pass them down to the view layer

- http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/ExampleRedditAPI.html
- move all actions to a separate file
- instead of dirty:
  - stale
  - expired
  - old
  - world changed
  - .. :(
- remember ({foo, bar, ...props})
- replace all usages of actions by action functions first
- move game loop into a middleware
- test ui using shallow rendering

- css in js npm install radium

- sufficiently local css is indistinguishable from inline styles
